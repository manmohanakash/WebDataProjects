So we’ve used our 30+ years of experience of making premium quality food for humans to create a revolutionary ‘real’ pet food with simple, easily recognisable ingredients. We insist on using human-grade cuts of meat or fish, no substitutes and absolutely no ‘animal derivatives’. Our food is completely pure and free from artificial colours, flavours and preservatives, added sugars, wheat, gluten, dairy, soya and GM ingredients (you could say it’s what we leave out that makes us different!).");

Although small breeds live twice as long as very large breeds, the big boys actually take longer to reach their adult body weight. So check with your breeder and/or your vet for guidance.");
INSERT INTO questions(question,answer) VALUES("Can Fleas Kill a Dog?","It’s not just the constant itching that flea bites cause – if left untreated, fleas are capable of reproducing and multiplying rapidly and the more fleas there are, the more blood your dog is losing. Think of it this way: an adult female flea can lay up to 50 eggs per day. And the more fleas that live on our dog, the more blood they suck – a female flea consumed up to 15 times her own body weight in blood daily!");
